## Introduction to HTML

In this section, we cover what HTML is, its role in web development, and why it's essential to learn.

## Basic HTML Structure

Learn about the basic structure of an HTML document, including the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

## HTML Elements

Understand the concept of HTML elements, how to use tags to structure content, and the difference between block-level and inline elements.

## HTML Attributes

Explore how HTML attributes provide additional information to elements and how they're used to modify an element's behavior or appearance.

## Text Formatting

Discover how to format text using HTML, including headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), emphasis (`<em>` and `<strong>`), and more.

## Links and Anchor Tags

Learn how to create hyperlinks in HTML using anchor (`<a>`) tags, including linking to external websites and internal pages.

## Forms

Learn how to create interactive forms using HTML's form-related elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc.) to collect user data.

## Semantic HTML

Discover the concept of semantic HTML and how using appropriate semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) improves web accessibility and search engine optimization.
