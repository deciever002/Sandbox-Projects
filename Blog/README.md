## Introduction to HTML

In this section, we cover what HTML is, its role in web development, and why it's essential to learn.

## Basic HTML Structure

Learn about the basic structure of an HTML document, including the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

## HTML Elements

Understand the concept of HTML elements, how to use tags to structure content, and the difference between block-level and inline elements.

## HTML Attributes

Explore how HTML attributes provide additional information to elements and how they're used to modify an element's behavior or appearance.

## Text Formatting

Discover how to format text using HTML, including headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), emphasis (`<em>` and `<strong>`), and more.

## Links and Anchor Tags

Learn how to create hyperlinks in HTML using anchor (`<a>`) tags, including linking to external websites and internal pages.

## Lists

## Images

Explore how to add images to your HTML pages using the `<img>` tag, including specifying image sources, alt text, and dimensions.

## Forms

Learn how to create interactive forms using HTML's form-related elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc.) to collect user data.

## Semantic HTML

Discover the concept of semantic HTML and how using appropriate semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) improves web accessibility and search engine optimization.

## HTML5 Elements

Explore some of the new HTML5 elements and features, such as `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and more.

## Resources

Find a collection of additional resources, including recommended books, online tutorials, and tools to further enhance your HTML skills.
